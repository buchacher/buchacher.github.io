Hi 👋, I'm interested in leveraging technology to elevate the human condition. 🫀 I've developed deep health sector domain expertise and through this repeatedly seen the tremendous potential that digital health can unlock. 🚀 This inspired me to teach myself to code and subsequently to pursue a MSc in Artificial Intelligence at the University of St Andrews. 👨‍🏫
